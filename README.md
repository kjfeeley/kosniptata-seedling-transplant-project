Collaborative Research: Understanding range limits and plant migration in response to climate change in neotropical montane forests: moving from observational models to mechanisms

PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding species responses to climate change is at its core a question of species performance and distribution across environmental gradients. Over the last 10 years, the PIs and their colleagues have used a Neotropical elevation gradient spanning 3500 m from Amazonian lowlands to Andean treeline as a natural laboratory for investigating forest and ecosystem ecology, documenting tree migration in response to climate change, and predicting species range changes and extinctions under scenarios of global change through species distribution modeling. Here a research program is proposed that seeks to advance the understanding of species range limits and responses to climate change by moving away from correlational exercises on databased records and towards a mechanistic understanding based on species performance. The approach uses experimental manipulations and ecophysiological measurements coupled with demographic and species distributions models. Seedling transplant experiments are used to investigate the importance of abiotic factors (temperature, soils), biotic factors (herbivory, fungal pathogens) and species properties (taxa observed to be migrating/not migrating at the site, life history characteristics) in determining performance at early life stages across species ranges. Ecophysiological and functional trait measurements are used to examine the basis of changes in vital rates and reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of differences in species responses to experimental treatments.  Results from the experiment are used in demographic modeling that explores population-level performance across species ranges, and in species distribution models incorporating species performance and ecophysiology to test for changes in predictions in species responses to future climate change scenarios.  

The proposed research has strong intellectual merit in that it will (1) increase our understanding of tree distributional ecology and range limits by specifically examining abiotic and biotic factors underpinning species fundamental and realized niches, (2) advance our understanding of the determination of range limits along environmental gradients, and (3) increase our ability to predict the effects of climate change on natural systems by providing data which can be incorporated into species distribution models. The research will increase and potentially transform our understanding of the basic ecology of tropical montane forests which despite their high biodiversity and important ecosystem services remain grossly understudied.

The proposed broader impact plan builds on those previously funded by NSF and the PI and Senior Personnelâ€™s existing relationships with Peruvian and US minority and K-12 institutions. The plan is specifically designed to have the broader impacts of (1) creating a suite of educational activities, resources, and opportunities aimed at teaching K-12 and college students about tropical ecology and the effects of global climate change, (2) creating training opportunities for international and minority students which will assist them in pursuing advanced education and/or careers in the natural sciences, and (3) disseminating results to a broad scientific and lay audience, including Spanish translations and versions of resources.
